# ShortestDistance-RobotTravel
Calculates the sortest distance travelled by a robot!

Give an input direction UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, and a distance the robot must travel, the program gives the shortest distance from (0,0).
You can choose to calculate the distance just for a single direction or keep moving the robot and calculate the final distance from (0,0).

## Example:

Robot moves: UP with distance = 5
Robot moves: DOWN with distance = 3
Robot moves: LEFT with distance = 3
Robot moves: RIGHT with distance = 2

Destination = (-1,2)

Distance from (0,0) to (-1,2) is sqrt(5)
